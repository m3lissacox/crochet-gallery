# Virtual Crochet Gallery

This is a beginner Dart web app for me to practice using Flutter. It is a work in progress!

Note: Run/build with the --no-sound-null-safety flag (added this to use a plugin to launch an external website)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
